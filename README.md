## 🚲 DO YOU COPY?

**Something is coming... something hungry for blood. A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness. It is almost here...**

But wait! There is a way to communicate.

**Stranger Wall** isn't just a website. It's a portal between dimensions. It turns your screen into the famous alphabet wall from the Byers' living room. 

*   **You** are trapped in the **Upside Down** (Sender). It's cold, it's dark, and there are spores floating everywhere.
*   **Your Friend** is safe in the **Overworld** (Receiver). They are waiting for a sign.

You type a letter... **R**... **U**... **N**.
And on their screen? The bulbs flash. The message is received. **RUN.**

## 🔗 OPEN THE PORTAL

👉 **[CLICK HERE TO ENTER THE UPSIDE DOWN](https://kshitij5228.github.io/Stranger-Things-Wall/)**

*(Warning: Possible Demogorgon sightings ahead. Proceed with caution.)*

## ✨ WHY IS THIS COOL?

*   **👻 Spooky Real-Time**: You type, they see it INSTANTLY. Faster than a Demodog running for food.
*   **💡 Visual Feast**: The lights don't just blink; they **glow**, they **flicker**, they feel **real**.
*   **🔊 Hear the Fear**: Every click has a sound. Every light has a hum. Turn your volume UP.
*   **🔦 Two-Way Connection**: Share the link, and boom—you are connected.

If you are a wizard (or a developer) and want to control the lights yourself:

1.  **Open the Gate (Clone)**

    cd stranger-wall
    ```

2.  **Gather Supplies (Install)**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Establish Connection (Firebase)**
    *   Go to [Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com/).
    *   Create a new project (call it "Hawkins-Lab" if you want).
    *   Get your API keys and stuff them into a `.env` file.

4.  **Cast the Spell (Run)**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
